# TODOII - A Todo Manager

This project is my first ReactJS based project. With this website you can manage your daily todos as the list gets stored on your local storage, hence giving you a better experience. The UI is kept minimal and is a bit responsive. The work is going on to make this website a fully responsive and functional. Use it on larger screens for better view and experience.
